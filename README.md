# smartLinux
Part of the smartLinux projects
This is a little project that adds a couple of smart features to any linux debian based distro.



THe first features that the script brings to your distro image are:



-Smart Brightness alias SmartB;

-Smart NightLight alias SmartNiLi;

-Smart Cpu Frequency alias SmartFRQX;




SmartB feature sets the brightness intensity to full between 8 AM and 18 PM to full and in the rest of the time it sets to ~ half of its potential brightness.

SmartNiLi feature brings to your desktop the ability to autostart the night-light between the 19 PM and 7 AM and fixes the night-light intensity bug by setting it to 5500k.

SmartFRQX feature adds to your linux pc the ability to set the cpu governor between performance and powersave if the laptop is plugged-in or discharging.
